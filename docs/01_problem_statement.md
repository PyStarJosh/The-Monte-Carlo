# Problem Statement
The Monte Carlo aims to help novice retail investors reasonably predict how their portfolio may perform over time.

## Motivation
Many retail investors have careers and other obligations that limit they're ability to learn delve into the nuanced world of investing. This leads to paralysis analysis as there is great uncertaintiy on how they're portfolio will perform until retirement. This project adds some clarity to retail investors through modeling portfolio probabilities and outcomes through simulations.

## Objectives
- Model future portfolio returns based on stochastic market conditions
- Allow for user inputs (assets, allocations, horizion, capital invested, etc.)
- Supports users testing the impact on potential black swan scenarios
- Provides inflation adjusted outcomes
- Provide visualization of probable outcomes

## Out of Scope (for now)
- Full Tax Modeling
- Bootstrap Modeling
- Mobile App
- Enhanced Monte Carlo Settings Customization
